  # CUBESAT
 Cubesats are small and standardized spacecraft used primarily for research purposes, typically launched into space as secondary payloads on larger missions or as part of dedicated small satellite launch programs.

# Why Cubesats?
##### Low cost.                              

Cubesats cost nearly as low as few thousand dollars as compared to the big satellites.
                                                                                                                                                         
##### Low mass and volume.
Cubesats weigh nearly 1 to 1.33 kg(1 unit) which increases the amount of cubesats that could be sent through the LMV.
                                                                                        
##### Lower power requirements.
Cubesats have lower power requirements of 5-20 Watts which makes it more efficient to work and send telemetery data to a ground station.

# Cubesat Dispenser System

                                                                                       
A CubeSat dispenser system refers to a mechanism designed to deploy CubeSats into space    (<img align="right" width="400" height="200" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df6b8e8c-08ee-41a5-9836-ce393471f083"> ...)  
from a larger spacecraft, typically a satellite or a launch vehicle. CubeSats are small     
standardized satellites that are commonly used for scientific research, technology demonstration, 
Earth observation, and various other purposes. The dispenser system plays a crucial role in safely
releasing these CubeSats into their intended orbits once the primary mission of the carrier spacecraft is completed.



# Devolopment processes
The development of a CubeSat typically follows several key phases, each essential for ensuring its successful deployment and mission performance:
1. Conceptualization and Mission Definition:
   - *Mission Definition*: Identify the mission objectives, scientific goals, or technology demonstration aims.
   - *Conceptual Design*: Determine the basic configuration and size of the CubeSat (e.g., 1U, 2U, 3U) based on payload requirements and mission objectives.
   - *Feasibility Study*: Assess the technical feasibility and potential challenges associated with achieving the mission goals.

2. Preliminary Design Phase (Phase A):
   - *System Requirements*: Define detailed mission and system requirements, including subsystems like power, communication, attitude control, and payload.
   - *Preliminary Design*: Develop initial designs and concepts for the CubeSat structure, subsystems, and integration approach.
   - *Concept Review*: Conduct a review to evaluate the feasibility of the preliminary design and make adjustments as necessary.

3. Detailed Design Phase (Phase B):
   - *Detailed Design*: Refine the design based on feedback from Phase A. Develop detailed specifications and plans for each subsystem and component.
   - *Manufacturing Plans*: Prepare detailed manufacturing plans for all CubeSat components, considering space-grade materials and fabrication techniques.
   - *Testing Plans*: Develop plans for environmental testing (thermal vacuum, vibration, radiation) to validate the CubeSat's design and ensure it can withstand the harsh conditions of space.

4. Manufacturing, Integration, and Testing Phase (Phase C):
   - *Component Manufacturing*: Manufacture and procure all necessary components and subsystems according to the detailed design specifications.
   - *Integration*: Assemble the CubeSat, integrating all subsystems and components into the final structure.
   - *Testing*: Perform rigorous testing including functional tests, subsystem tests, and environmental tests to verify the CubeSat's performance and readiness for space.

5. Launch Preparation and Operations Phase (Phase D)*:
   - *Launch Campaign*: Coordinate with launch service providers to secure a launch opportunity and integrate the CubeSat with the launch vehicle.
   - *Pre-launch Checks*: Conduct final checks and preparations to ensure the CubeSat is ready for launch.
   - *Launch*: Deploy the CubeSat into its intended orbit from the launch vehicle.

6. Operations and Data Analysis Phase (Phase E):
   - *Commissioning*: Activate and configure the CubeSat in orbit, ensuring all systems are functioning correctly.
   - *Mission Operations*: Operate the CubeSat from ground control, monitor its health, and execute the mission plan to collect data or perform experiments.
   - *Data Analysis*: Analyze data collected by the CubeSat to assess mission success and achieve scientific or technological objectives.

7. Mission Conclusion and Post-Mission Phase (Phase F):
   - *Decommissioning*: If necessary, plan for the safe decommissioning or deorbiting of the CubeSat at the end of its mission.
   - *Data Dissemination*: Archive mission data and prepare final reports or publications summarizing mission achievements and findings.
   - *Lessons Learned*: Conduct a review to identify lessons learned and areas for improvement in future CubeSat missions.

 # Cubesat Payload

 


 The payload in CubeSats and small satellites typically consists of instruments or equipment          (<img align="right" width="300" height="250" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fd633b8-00be-462d-9f45-232cf27a9264"> ...)                      
 that enable  specific mission objectives such as Earth observation, remote sensing, communications, research                    
 specific mission objectives such as Earth observation, remote sensing, communications, research                     
 specific mission objectives such as Earth observation, remote sensing, communications, research                     
 or other technology demonstrations. Often being the most expensive part of the satellite, 
 payload integration requires precise handling and careful installation. Compatibility issues
 may arise when integrating payloads from different manufacturers into CubeSats and small satellites.
