# Introduction To CubeSats

  ## CUBESAT
 Cubesats are small and standardized spacecraft used primarily for research purposes, typically launched into space as secondary payloads on larger missions or as part of dedicated small satellite launch programs. 
![Cubesat-Dimensions-678x230](https://github.com/Pooja6608/SI-2024-Cubesat-SU/assets/173778746/a175f042-6e5f-407a-95ff-87a541aa2e65)
## Why Cubesats?
##### Low cost.                              

Cubesats cost nearly as low as few thousand dollars as compared to the big satellites.
                                                                                                                                                         
##### Low mass and volume.
Cubesats weigh nearly 1 to 1.33 kg(1 unit) which increases the amount of cubesats that could be sent through the LMV.
                                                                                        
##### Lower power requirements.
Cubesats have lower power requirements of 5-20 Watts which makes it more efficient to work and send telemetery data to a ground station.

## Cubesat Dispenser System

                                                                                       
A CubeSat dispenser system refers to a mechanism designed to deploy CubeSats into space    (<img align="right" width="400" height="200" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df6b8e8c-08ee-41a5-9836-ce393471f083"> ...)  
from a larger spacecraft, typically a satellite or a launch vehicle. CubeSats are small     
standardized satellites that are commonly used for scientific research, technology demonstration, 
Earth observation, and various other purposes. The dispenser system plays a crucial role in safely
releasing these CubeSats into their intended orbits once the primary mission of the carrier spacecraft is completed.

 ## Cubesat Payload

 


 The payload in CubeSats and small satellites typically consists of instruments or equipment          
 that enable  specific mission objectives such as Earth observation, remote sensing, communications, research                    
 specific mission objectives such as Earth observation, remote sensing, communications, research                     
 specific mission objectives such as Earth observation, remote sensing, communications, research                     
 or other technology demonstrations. Often being the most expensive part of the satellite, 
 payload integration requires precise handling and careful installation. Compatibility issues
 may arise when integrating payloads from different manufacturers into CubeSats and small satellites.

 ## Cubesat Architecture

 The term "CubeSat architecture" generally refers to the standardized design specifications and components that define these small satellites. Here are the key aspects of CubeSat architecture:

*  CubeSat Units (U): CubeSats come in standardized sizes called "Units" or "U." The most common size is the 1U CubeSat, which is a cube with dimensions of 10x10x10 centimeters (1 liter in volume). Larger sizes include 2U (10x10x20 cm), 3U (10x10x30 cm), and so on, up to 12U.

* Structure: CubeSats typically have a cubic or rectangular structure made from aluminum or composite materials. The structure provides mechanical support for the satellite components and often includes deployable solar panels for power generation.

* Payload: CubeSats carry scientific instruments, sensors, or experimental payloads tailored to specific mission objectives. These payloads can include cameras, spectrometers, communication systems, and more.

* Avionics: The avionics of a CubeSat include the onboard computer, communication systems (such as radio transmitters and receivers), attitude determination and control systems (ADCS), and power distribution systems. These components are often custom-designed to fit within the small form factor and weight limitations of the CubeSat.

* Power: CubeSats typically use solar panels mounted on the outer surfaces of the satellite to generate electrical power from sunlight. Batteries are used to store energy for use when the satellite is not in sunlight (e.g., during eclipse periods).

* Communication: CubeSats communicate with ground stations using radio frequencies allocated for satellite communications. They may use omnidirectional or directional antennas depending on mission requirements.

# Digital Modulation 

  Digital modulation is the process of encoding a digital information signal into the amplitude, phase, or frequency of the transmitted signal. The encoding process affects the bandwidth of the transmitted 
  signal and its robustness to channel impairments.
 - Digital modulation techniques:

   and fabrication of integrated circuits (ICs), which are electronic circuits that
   are made up of a large number of transistors and other components that are integrated
   into a single chip. the technology allows for the creation oh highly complex and compact
   ICs that can be used in a wide range of applications, from consumer 
  electronics and computers to communication systems and medical devices.

    - The following are the primary advantages of VLSI technology:

       -  Reduced size for circuits
