# Introduction To CubeSats

  ## CUBESAT
 Cubesats are small and standardized spacecraft used primarily for research purposes, typically launched into space as secondary payloads on larger missions or as part of dedicated small satellite launch programs. 
![Cubesat-Dimensions-678x230](https://github.com/Pooja6608/SI-2024-Cubesat-SU/assets/173778746/a175f042-6e5f-407a-95ff-87a541aa2e65)
## Why Cubesats?
##### Low cost.                              

Cubesats cost nearly as low as few thousand dollars as compared to the big satellites.
                                                                                                                                                         
##### Low mass and volume.
Cubesats weigh nearly 1 to 1.33 kg(1 unit) which increases the amount of cubesats that could be sent through the LMV.
                                                                                        
##### Lower power requirements.
Cubesats have lower power requirements of 5-20 Watts which makes it more efficient to work and send telemetery data to a ground station.

## Cubesat Dispenser System

  # INTRODUCTION TO ANTENNA      
   An antenna is a fundamental component in the field of electromagnetics and telecommunications     <img align="right" width="300" height="180" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8120f158-3d85-4d76-a79d-4d89acecbf43"> 
   serving as a crucial interface between electrical circuits and electromagnetic waves. Its primary
   function is to transmit or receive electromagnetic signals. 
   

   



   ### Basic Principles

   1. **Radiation and Reception**: Antennas are designed to radiate electromagnetic waves into space or receive such waves from the environment. The effectiveness of an antenna is measured by its ability to 
       efficiently convert electrical signals into electromagnetic waves (radiation) or vice versa (reception).     

   2. **Electromagnetic Wave Interaction**: When an alternating current flows through an antenna, it generates an oscillating electric field. According to Maxwell's equations, this oscillating electric field then
       induces a corresponding oscillating magnetic field, and together they propagate away from the antenna as an electromagnetic wave.   

  ### Types of Antennas

  Antennas come in various shapes and sizes, each with its own characteristics and applications:

   1. **Wire Antennas**: Simplest form of antennas consisting of conductive wires or rods, such as dipoles, monopoles, and loops.
   
   2. **Aperture Antennas**: These antennas use openings or slots to radiate electromagnetic waves, like waveguide antennas and slot antennas.   


  3. **Array Antennas**: Multiple antenna elements arranged to achieve desired radiation patterns and properties, such as phased arrays used in radar and communication systems.

  4. **Printed Antennas**: Antennas fabricated on printed circuit boards (PCBs), often used in modern wireless devices due to their compact size and ease of integration.

 ### Antenna Characteristics

  1. **Radiation Pattern**: Describes the directional dependence of the radiated or received electromagnetic fields. It shows how power is distributed in space around the antenna.

  2. **Impedance Matching**: Ensuring that the antenna's impedance (a measure of how much it resists the flow of electrical current) matches that of the transmission line or receiver circuitry for efficient 
       power transfer.

  3. **Bandwidth**: Range of frequencies over which the antenna can operate effectively without significant degradation in performance.

  4. **Gain**: Measure of the antenna's ability to direct or concentrate transmitted/received power in a particular direction compared to an ideal isotropic radiator.

#### Lab 14: Introduction to antenna modeling and simulation software 4NEC2.
   - 4NEC2 is a popular antenna modeling and simulation software used primarily for designing and analyzing antennas.
    - It is based on the Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC-2) simulation engine, which is a method of moments (MoM) solver for electromagnetic structures.
    - [4nec2](LABS/4nec2)
#### Lab 15: Physical design of Dipole and V-dipole antennas
  - Tune it to 433MHz with the help of NanoVNA-A Portable VNA Antenna Analyzer Kit with 10KHz-1.5GHz, 2.8 Inch Digital LCD Display Touching Screen Standing Wave Measuring Instrument.
  -  **Design Considerations for Both Antennas:**
        - **Frequency of Operation:** Determine the wavelength (Î») corresponding to the operating frequency to calculate the appropriate dipole lengths.
        - **Environment:** Consider the surroundings (e.g., near buildings, ground plane effects) as they can affect the antenna's impedance and radiation pattern.
        - **Simulation and Testing:** Use antenna modeling software (like 4NEC2) or practical measurements to validate antenna performance and adjust dimensions as needed.
        - **Feedline Matching:** Implement baluns or impedance matching networks to ensure efficient power transfer between the transmitter and antenna.

#### Lab 18: Processing TLE data with Python

   A two-line element set (TLE, or more rarely 2LE) or three-line element set (3LE) is a data format encoding a list of orbital elements of an Earth-orbiting object for a given point in time, the epoch. Using a 
    suitable prediction formula, the state (position and velocity) at any point in the past or future can be estimated to some accuracy. 

   * Here is the  code for latitude and longitude generation using TLE is as follows->[here](https://github.com/Rajesh100903/SI-2024-22BECB73/blob/main/Lab/TLE)

  
   * the location of satelite is -[Lat,Long](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=29.54667195811989,-151.8386296562339)  
#### Lab 19: Simulating Digital Spread Spectrum Modulation
  - Resimulate FSK from Lab 8
  - Introduce code to convert the digital data into spread spectrum before modulating it to a higher frequency.
  - Simulating Digital Spread Spectrum Modulation involves using software tools to model and analyze the behavior of spread spectrum communication techniques, which are widely used in wireless communication 
   systems for their robustness against interference and security advantages.
  - Spread spectrum modulation techniques spread the signal over a wider bandwidth compared to the minimum necessary for the transmission of information.
